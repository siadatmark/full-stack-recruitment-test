# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
I have started using an existing template, not everything is actually in use
[https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-admin-template](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-admin-template)

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?
As the readme file was expecting

(Default) `npm start`
* `npm start` - This will start the application for development
* `npm run build` - Will create a production optimised build
* `npm test` - Will run the front end tests
* `npm run lint` - Will run the code through our linting rules
Check **package.json** file, **scripts** section
